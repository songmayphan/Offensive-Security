Run the virtual hard disk file on your Virtual Box or VMWare. You should see this welcome screen:

The default username is `msfadmin` and the password is also `msfadmin`

# Firing up our target

Run ```ifconfig``` to get the target's inet address. We'll need this when we launch on exploit. 

See Metasploit.md to run our exploit
