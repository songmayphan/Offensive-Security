# Metasploit
Metasploit is a framework used in pen-testing that simplified hacking.

## Vocabulary
- Payload = **exploit module**. They are simple scripts used to interact with the target. A payload can transfer data to the victim's system.
- Exploit = **a hacking activity* *. An exploit is either  **active** : exploit a specific host, run until completion, and then exit *or* **passive**: wait for incoming hosts and exploit them as they connect.

### Active Exploits
Command to make a module active
```
exploit -j
```
